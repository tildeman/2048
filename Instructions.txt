1. Find the latest exe build in 2048/bin(Currently 1-11-mloop.exe)
2. Run the file.
3. Use the arrow keys to move blocks to the direction.
4. During the game, there will be 2 lighter blocks merging into one. This indicates that the block's value doubled!
5. You'll see the text 'Game over' if there are no more moves or 'You got 2048' if the darkest block is 2048 (color-dependent)
6. You'll need to restart the program on whatever text is displayed.
